This is repository where I store class assignments and projects for RIT's HCIN 720.

## Assignment 1

This assignment required the use of a web API to visualize data. The web API I chose was the [Instagram API](https://instagram.com/developer/).

### Part 1
For the time-based graph, I used the API to gather Instagram posting activity at RIT. Using the GPS coordinates of RIT as parameters for the API, I grabbed timestamps of each Instagram post within the area for the past 24 hours. These timestamps were then binned in order to plot them in a graph displaying the number of posts per hour at RIT. The latest image post to Instagram is also displayed next to this graph.

The data updates every 30 seconds, which any necessary changes made to the graph and the latest image. The graph only displays the past 24 hours, so if the latest change is in a new hour, the x-axis shifts over. The y-axis also dynamically updates, depending on the maximum number of posts per hour.

Libraries used in this visualization:
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [d3](http://d3js.org/) - for easier graph creation
* [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - for some css styling

### Part 2
For the abstract visualization, I used the API to gather images that are tagged with one of the 4 seasons (fall, winter, spring, summer). The 5 most dominant colors in each image are then determined and "splattered" onto the screen in their respective season category.

The paint splatters are updated every 10 seconds when new tagged images are retrieved from Instagram. If more than 100 pseudo paint splatters exist for a season, the earliest splatters are removed to keep a maximum of 100 splatters per season.

Libraries used in this visualization:
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) - for splatter visualization
* [Color Thief](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/) - nifty library for retrieving dominant colors from an image
* [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)

## Assignment 2

This assignment required the use of a Photon with sensors to send data over a serial port and via the cloud. The circuit I built was designed for watching the status of a plant (both its soil moisture level and how much light it is getting), in addition to providing a feature through the cloud to remotely water the plant.

### Circuit

![Circuit setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amandayung/hcin720/master/assignment2/circuit-setup.png)

The circuit includes:
* a photoresistor: this sensor reports how much light the plant is currently receiving. This data is sent both through the serial port and via the cloud. Both are in JSON format.
* a soil moisture sensor: this sensor reports how much water is currently in the soil. This data is sent both through the serial port and via the cloud. Both are in JSON format.
* a servo: Attached to the servo is a small plastic container that can be filled with water. When monitoring the plant via the web page, you can press a button to call a function that turns the servo on to dump the water into the plant's pot.
* a speaker: Once the plant is watered (based on the current moisture level), the circuit also plays a quick song to let you know you watered the plant successfully. Since this feature is based on checking the change in moisture level of the soil, it will also play music if you water the plant yourself.

### Visualization

For the visualization of the photoresistor data, a line graph displays the amount of light the plant is currently receiving (this is on a scale of 0-100% light, based on an inverse relationship to the amount of resistance in the photoresistor). This dynamically updates as data is received every second.

This assignment's line graph is different from the previous assignment's, as it updates more dynamically. The x-axis is now continually scrolling based on the current time, as opposed to the previous graph which only updated its axis every hour.

The moisture sensor data is displayed via an image of a plant: if the plant is upright, this indicates there is plenty of water in the soil. However, if the water level is lower than optimal, the plant begins to droop. When the soil is very dry, the plant is extremely droopy, almost falling out of its pot. This "droopiness" of the plant is controlled by a quadratic bezier curve. The vector between the "control point" of the curve and the end point is rotated in order to achieve this effect. The plant droopiness is updated dynamically as moisture sensor data is received.
